        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          The Favorite Dogs Club was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate
          dog lovers who wanted to create a space where dog enthusiasts could
          come together. Over the years, the club has grown from a small
          community to a large network of dog lovers who share a common love for
          these amazing animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission has always been simple: to create a supportive community
          where we can all share our love for dogs, learn more about them, and
          make a difference in the lives of our furry companions.
